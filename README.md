# Basics Arduino


Welcome to my GitHub repository where I showcase various electronics projects. Each project is designed to demonstrate the use of different components and technologies.

## Projects

### 1. Distance Sensor
- Description: This project utilizes a distance sensor to measure the distance between the sensor and an object. The code provides a simple interface to read and display the distance.

### 2. Temperature Sensor
- Description: An implementation of a temperature sensor project. The code reads the temperature data from the sensor and provides a user-friendly output.

### 3. RC Car with Buttons
- Description: Control a remote-controlled (RC) car using physical buttons. The code includes functions for forward, backward, left, and right movements.

### 4. LCD 16x2
- Description: Display text on a 16x2 LCD screen. The code includes examples of how to print messages and control the display.

### 5. Keypad 4x4
- Description: Interact with a 4x4 keypad. The code demonstrates how to read input from the keypad and perform actions based on the entered keys.

### 6. Countdown Display
- Description: A countdown timer implemented with a 7-segment display. The code allows you to set the countdown duration and displays the remaining time.

### 7. Traffic Light
- Description: A simple traffic light project with three LEDs. The code simulates the standard traffic light sequence of red, yellow, and green lights.

## Usage
Each project folder contains the necessary source code and additional resources. Follow the instructions in each project's README file for setup and usage details.
